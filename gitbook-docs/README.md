# Python Templates for LeetCode

[![Python](https://custom-icon-badges.herokuapp.com/badge/Python-3.10-blue?style=flat-square\&logo=python\&logoColor=white)](https://docs.python.org/3.10/) [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/yangzhou301)](https://twitter.com/yangzhou301) [![LeetCode user xy-li](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?style=flat-square\&labelColor=black\&color=%23ffa116\&label=Solved\&query=solvedOverTotal\&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbadge.xyli.tech/%2Fapi%2Fusers%2Fxy-li\&logo=leetcode\&logoColor=yellow)](https://leetcode.com/xy-li/)

:mega: This website is still **updating slowly** due to some difficulties in my academic events in school. If you have any suggestions of:

* New algorithm/programming topics (e.g., how about creating a template about _trie_?)
* More and better problem examples for existing topics
* Proof-reading

Please comment \ on the corresponding pages, and your comment will be kept as a comment for a GitHub issue permanently. Besides, pull requests to correct me or add new content are definitely welcome.



### Notes

1. Some problems are listed without solutions for exercises in each topic, which are promised to be solvable by the provided template (because at least I have already passed them with the template) but _may not be the best solutions for the problems_.
2. The difficulty levels marked for those problems may be **varied** from the levels given by LeetCode officially because it is just my measurement for difficulty levels.
3. Sometimes, I may give some challenges marked as <mark style="background-color:blue;">advanced</mark> from sources other than LeetCode, which seem more challenging and can't be solved by the template directly. But a step forward from the **idea** in the templates may help solve them. Thus, I just leave them as _optional_ challenges.
4. I never have a _premium_ subscription on `leetcode.com` or `leetcode.cn` due to my poor financial condition. I won't list any _premium_ problem as material on this site because **I guarantee to verify all solutions I post**. Of course, I'll extremely appreciate it if you are willing to[ sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/li-xin-yi) with a _premium_ subscription on either LeetCode site to encourage me to update some _premium_ problems.
