## Notes

1. Some problems are listed without solutions for exercises in each topic, which are promised to be solvable by the provided template (because at least I have already passed them with the template) but *may not be the best solutions for the problems*. 
2. The difficulty levels marked for those problems may be **varied** from the levels given by LeetCode officially because it is just my measurement for difficulty.
3. Sometimes, I may give some challenges (marked as {badge}`Advanced,badge-info badge-pill`) from sources other than LeetCode, which seem more challenging and can't be solved by the template directly. But a step forward from the **idea** in the templates may help solve them. Thus, I just leave them as *optional* challenges.
