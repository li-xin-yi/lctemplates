{opticon}`megaphone` This website is still **updating slowly** due to some difficulties in my academic events in school. If you have any suggestion of:
- New algorithm/programming topics (e.g., how about create a template about *trie*?)
- More and better problem examples for existing topics
- Proof-reading

Please comment {opticon}`comment` on the corresponding pages, and your comment will be kept as a comment for a GitHub issue {opticon}`issue-opened` permanently. Besides, pull requests {opticon}`git-pull-request` to correct me or add new contents are definitely welcome.

## Notes

1. Some problems are listed without solutions for exercises in each topic, which are promised to be solvable by the provided template (because at least I have already passed them with the template) but *may not be the best solutions for the problems*. 
2. The difficulty levels marked for those problems may be **varied** from the levels given by LeetCode officially because it is just my measurement for difficulty levels.
3. Sometimes, I may give some challenges (marked as {badge}`Advanced,badge-info badge-pill`) from sources other than LeetCode, which seem more challenging and can't be solved by the template directly. But a step forward from the **idea** in the templates may help solve them. Thus, I just leave them as *optional* challenges.
4. I never have a *premium* subscription on leetcode.com or leetcode.cn due to my poor financial condition. I won't list any *premium* problem as material on this site because **I guarantee to verify all solutions I post**. Of course, I'll extremely appreciate it if you are willing to [{opticon}`gift` sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/li-xin-yi) with a *premium* subscription on either LeetCode site to encourage me to update some *premium* problems. {badge}`cyber begging,badge-dark badge-pill`

## More about me

- [My solutions for LeetCode weekly contests](http://notebook.xyli.me/categories/LeetCode/) (*Chinese only, very very early stage, till 174 (02/01/2020)*)
- [My paper reading notes](https://paper-weekly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), mainly about ML/Security.
- The LeetCode badges on the header are generated by [badges.xyli.codes](https://badges.xyli.codes/) (star me: [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/li-xin-yi/leetcode-badge?style=social)](https://github.com/li-xin-yi/leetcode-badge)), I modified code from [@cascandaliato's leetcode-badge](https://github.com/cascandaliato/leetcode-badge) to add contest rating and data for users in [leetcode.cn](https://leetcode.cn/).
- Open to any dev/research intern opportunity ({opticon}`location` US or remote). If you have interest in working with me, please contact [{opticon}`mail` wolixinyi@gmail.com](mailto:wolixinyi@gmail.com)
- [{opticon}`gift` Sponsor me!](https://github.com/sponsors/li-xin-yi) I'm in a poor financial condition due to the suspending research funding now. I can hardly survive this summer, help me! {badge}`cyber begging,badge-dark badge-pill`
