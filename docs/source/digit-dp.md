# Digit DP

**Target Problem**: 
- Count the number with some specific properties in a range $[L, R]$.
- The requirements are usually related to the digits of the number, e.g., the sum of digits, the number of certain digits, etc.
- The upper limit $R$ can be as large as $10^{18}$ or even $10^{100}$, we can't enumerate all the numbers in the range.
