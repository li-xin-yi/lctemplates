# Computational Geometry

{badge}`TODO,badge-danger badge-pill`

> This section collects some computational geometry problems on LeetCode ï¼ˆroughly, you can search the tag {bdg-link-primary-line}`geometry <https://leetcode.com/tag/geometry/>`. I also enroll in a course on computational geometry in this semester, so this section is also built to help me review the course content. Problems are added gradually, and there might not be a detailed explanation for each problem.

## Convex Hull

The [convex hull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull) problem refers to a classic problem that

> Given a set of points in the plane, find the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points in the set.

Usually, it requires to find out the set of **vertices** of the convex hull.
